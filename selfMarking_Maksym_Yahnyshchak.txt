Functionality A+

Program is read from the int array, a loop is implemented to execute the program 
(program counter is used), code is executed based on instruction opcode and func 
fields. Support for R-type instructions parsing and execution (add, srl, sll),
support for R-type instructions parsing and execution (addi, andi, lui).
Also, support for branch (bne) and word-wise data access (lw,sw)
instructions parsing and execution, registers are handled correctly in all cases, there is 
a method to terminate the program (e.g. nop).
The emulator executes correctly complex MIPS programs, pc register holds realistic 
text area addresses, support for half-word data access (lhu, sh).

Comments/clarity/organization A

Clear structure (and helpful comments) about variable use. Well commented 
throughout. Spaced and organised for clarity. Appropriate use of function to organize 
code.
